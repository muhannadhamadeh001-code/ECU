# Communication Interfaces

## CAN Bus
The board uses a CAN transceiver to communicate over CANH and CANL
as a differential pair.

Optional termination resistors can be enabled using jumpers.

## USB
USB-C is used for programming and debugging.
D+ and D- carry USB data.
RX and TX carry UART data via the USB-UART bridge.
