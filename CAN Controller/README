This directory contains the design of a 4-layer ESP32-based controller board
designed for automotive and embedded applications.

The board integrates:
- CAN bus communication
- Automotive 12V power input
- Buck power conversion
- USB-C programming and debugging
- ESD and surge protection
- RF-aware layout for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

The project is designed following real hardware design practices
with emphasis on signal integrity, EMI reduction, and reliability.
