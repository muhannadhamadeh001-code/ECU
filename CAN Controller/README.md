# ESP32 Automotive CAN Controller

This project is a custom designed automotive CAN controller based on the ESP32.
It is intended as a way to learn hardware platform
covering automotive power design, communication buses, and firmware development.

## Key Features
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Automotive CAN interface
- USB-C for firmware flashing and debugging
- Automotive 12V input with protection
- Buck + LDO power architecture
- ESD and transient protection

## Documentation
Detailed design documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:
- System overview and block diagram
- Power architecture
- Communication interfaces
- Firmware concepts
- Protection mechanisms

## Project Status
This repository documents Version 1 (V1) of the hardware design.
The design is complete but has not yet been manufactured or tested.
Future revisions will be documented separately.
