# ESP32 Automotive CAN Controller

This project is a custom-designed automotive CAN controller based on the ESP32.
It is intended as a learning-focused yet production-oriented hardware platform
covering automotive power design, communication buses, and firmware development.

## Key Features
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Automotive CAN interface
- USB-C for firmware flashing and debugging
- Automotive 12V input with protection
- Buck + LDO power architecture
- ESD and transient protection

## Documentation
Detailed design documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:
- System overview and block diagram
- Power architecture
- Communication interfaces
- Firmware concepts
- Protection mechanisms

This repository focuses on **engineering correctness**, not hobby-level shortcuts.
