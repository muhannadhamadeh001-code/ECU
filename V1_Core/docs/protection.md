# Protection Mechanisms

Automotive environments are electrically harsh.
This design includes multiple protection layers.

## Input Protection
- Reverse polarity protection
- Transient suppression
- Automotive-grade filtering

## ESD Protection
- USB and CAN lines protected using TVS diodes
- Prevents damage from electrostatic discharge events

## CAN Bus Protection
- Differential ESD protection on CANH / CANL
- Robust against noise and external disturbances

Protection ensures reliability, safety, and longevity.
