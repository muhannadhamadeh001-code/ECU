# ECU V2.5 — Inertial Measurement & Sensor Fusion Board

## Purpose
V2.5 is a dedicated inertial sensing board that provides raw and filtered inertial measurements (accel + gyro) to the ECU core (V1) to enable sensor fusion and state estimation in firmware.

## Scope
- 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- SPI interface to V1 (preferred)
- Optional IMU_INT line
- Powered from +3V3, DGND reference

## Non-Scope
- No actuator driving
- No safety logic (no ACT_PERMIT / KILL / ISO-26262 concepts)
- ECU must remain safe without V2.5

## Interfaces
### V1 (Core)
- SPI: MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS
- Optional: IMU_INT
- Power: +3V3
- Ground: DGND
- Sensor fusion runs on V1 firmware

### V2 / V3 / V4
- No hardware dependency
- Used only as informational/control-support input in V5

## Hardware Summary
- IMU: LSM6DSOX (SPI mode)
- Power: +3V3_IN -> ferrite bead -> +3V3_IMU
- Decoupling: 2x100nF + 10uF near IMU

## Signals
Minimum:
- SPI_MOSI
- SPI_MISO
- SPI_SCK
- SPI_CS_IMU
- +3V3
- DGND
Optional:
- IMU_INT

## Notes
- This board intentionally does not carry silkscreen labeling; axis labeling and integration markings are reserved for V5.
